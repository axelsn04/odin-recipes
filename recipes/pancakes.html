        <li>1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface (about 2-3 minutes), then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious pancakes!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These pancakes are perfect for a cozy breakfast or brunch with family and friends. Feel free to add chocolate chips, blueberries, or nuts to the batter for extra flavor!</p>
    <p>Note: You can make the batter ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Just give it a good stir before cooking.</p>
