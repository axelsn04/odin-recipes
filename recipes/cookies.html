    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked; they will firm up as they cool.</li>

        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade cookies!</li>
